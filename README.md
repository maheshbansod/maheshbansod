# Hello, it's Light! :wave:

I love to code. I love science. I love seeing the world progress beyond people's imaginations. I want to create a future filled with fun.

At work, I'm mostly using TypeScript for web development or for tools that ease some aspects of web development.  
Sometimes, I use Python for AI-related POCs.  

Outside work, I love working in Rust and TypeScript. I work on random personal projects and try out new libraries.
